# dash-listener

Repo for my Amazon Dash button listener that does different actions when I press one of my Dash buttons.

A fair amount of this is going to be specific to my setup, but still might be useful as a forking point :)

Note: Must be run with elevated privileges, because the mechanism for listening to presses is to sniff the network for ARP requests.
